Design an error detection and correction block for a microprocessor based on hamming code. 
Data in and data out are flopped. Data is 128 bits wide. 
Appropriate enable signals allow power savings.

Specifications:

* Data_in is 128 bit wide. Parity bits should be adequate to provide SEC-DED 
  (Single error correction, Double error detection). Use Hamming code.
* To save power load the registers only when corresponding data_valid signals are asserted high.
* Synthesize the RTL and optimize the energy consumption and delay of the circuit.
